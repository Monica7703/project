https://github.com/Monica7703/dino-side-scroller-game

## Description
This is a simple yet engaging 2D side-scrolling game where the player controls a dino that jumps to avoid obstacles. The project showcases interactive game design using Python and Pygame, relevant to digital arts and media through visual storytelling, animation, and user interaction.

## Features
- **Jumping Dino Character**
  - The Dino jumps when the player presses the spacebar. This is implemented using velocity and gravity in Pygame.
- **Scrolling Obstacles**
  - Rectangular obstacles move from right to left and reset with random spacing. Adds challenge and movement to the game.
- **Collision Detection**
  - The game ends when the dino touches an obstacle using Pygameâ€™s `colliderect()` method.
- **Score System**
  - A simple score counter based on time or number of passed obstacles.
- **Visual & Audio Feedback (Stretch Feature)**
  - Sprites or images for the Dino, background music, and sound effects for jumping or collisions.

## Challenges
- Learning to use sprite images and animation in Pygame.
- Implementing smooth difficulty scaling (e.g
